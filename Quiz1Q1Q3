### Price of a bond that pays coupon C every 6 months until maturity and and the face value F at maturity
#### Write a program in R to calculate the price of the bond, given its coupon C, face value F, 
### the number of coupon payments n, and the interest rate y(0.5),y(1),...,y(n). 
### (Assume that the time to the ﬁrst coupon payment is 6 months.) 

y= c(yt1,yt2,...,ytn)

npvfunction1 <- function(y,n){
  out <- 0
  for (j in 1:length(y){
    out <- out +exp(-y[j]*n)
  })
  return(out)
}

NPV = C * npvfunction1(y,n) + F *exp(-ytn*n)

#### (a) Read the dataset into R and name it dataset #######

setwd("C:/Users/heidi/Dropbox/Personal/MQ Uni ACST890/ACST890/Take home quiz 1")
singapore_economy <- read.csv("singapore.economy.csv")
View(singapore_economy)
head(singapore_economy)
dim(singapore_economy)
 
#### (b) Some data ﬁelds contain NA. Please exclude all records that contain NA ####
singapore_economy=na.omit(singapore_economy)
summary(singapore_economy)
head(singapore_economy)
dim(singapore_economy)

#### (c)  Plot Singapore GDP against time. Label horizontal axis as ’Time’; label vertical axis as ’GDP (%)’. ####
#### Put a title ’Singapore GDP growth’ on above the plot.####

plot(singapore_economy$time,singapore_economy$gdp,main="Singapore GDP growth",xlab="time",ylab = "Singapore GDP")

#### (d)  Calculate the mean and standard deviation of Singapore GDP for each of the three periods deﬁned by variable period.####
#### Then use the calculated statistics for each period to create a data table named ’stat.table’. ####
library(data.table)
gdp1<- subset(singapore_economy$gdp,period=='1')
head(gdp1)
gdp2<- subset(singapore_economy$gdp,period=='2')
head(gdp2)
gdp3<- subset(singapore_economy$gdp,period=='3')
head(gdp3)

mean_gdp1=mean(gdp1)
mean_gdp2=mean(gdp2)
mean_gdp3=mean(gdp3)
mean_gdp=c(mean_gdp1,mean_gdp2,mean_gdp3)
mean_gdp

sd_gdp1=sd(gdp1)
sd_gdp2=sd(gdp2)
sd_gdp3=sd(gdp3)
sd_gdp=c(sd_gdp1,sd_gdp2,sd_gdp3)
sd_gdp

stat.table=data.frame(mean_gdp,sd_gdp)
stat.table

#### (e) Using function pairs(), provide a scatterplot for every pair of variables in the dataset, except for time and period. ###
pairs(~gdp+exp+epg+crd+hpr+gdpus+oil+bci,data = singapore_economy)

#### (f)  Use the lm() function to perform a simple linear regression with gdp as the response and exp as the predictor. ###
#### Use the summary() function to print the results. Comment on the output. ####
lm.fit = lm(gdp~exp,data = singapore_economy)
summary(lm.fit)

### Comments: ###
### there is a relationship between exp and gdp as deterined by testing the null hypothesis of all regression coefficients equal to zero. 
### Since the F-statistic is larger and the p-value of the F-statistic is close to zero we can reject the null hypothesis 
### and state there is a statistically significant relationship between exp and gdp.
### To calculate the residual error relative to the response we use the mean of the response and the RSE. 
### The R2 of the lm.fit was about 0.2879, meaning 28.79% of the variance in gdp is explained by exp.
### The relationship between exp and gdp is positive. 
### The higher the Export Growth rate is, the linear regression indicatesthe higher GDP growth rate will be.

##### (g) Fit a multiple regression model to predict gdp using the following variables: exp, epg, hpr, oil, gdpus, crd. ###
#### Use the summary() function to print the results. Comment on the output. ###
lm.fit=lm(gdp~exp+epg+hpr+oil+gdpus+crd, data = singapore_economy)
summary(lm.fit)

### Comments: ###
### There is a relatioship between the predictors and the response by testing the null hypothesis of whether all the regression coefficients are zero. 
### The F -statistic is relatively away from 1 (with a small p-value), indicating evidence against the null hypothesis.
### Looking at the p-values associated with each predictor’s t-statistic, we see that exp and epg have a statistically significant relationship, 
### while hpr, oil, gdpus and crd do not.
### The regression coefficient for exp and epg are both positive, suggests that an increases in Export growth rate and/or Real price of main equity
### will contribute to an increase in GDP growth rate.


#### (h) Calculate the 5% quantile of gdp using function quantile(). 
gdp_5_quantile= quantile(singapore_economy$gdp,c(0.05))
gdp_5_quantile

### The economy is said to be in a crisis state if gdp is lower than its 0.05 quantile, and in a normal state otherwise. 
### Based on gdp, create a factor vector for the economy state and name it state. 
### Then put this vector in the dataset using the data.frame() function. 
crisis_state <- rep("1",nrow(singapore_economy))
crisis_state [singapore_economy$gdp > -2.518439]= "0"
crisis_state=as.factor(crisis_state)
singapore_economy_state =data.frame(singapore_economy,crisis_state)
head(singapore_economy_state)
View(singapore_economy_state)
summary(crisis_state)
### crisis state = 1, normal state = 0 ###

### For the state, ﬁt the logistic regression model using up to year 2007 as training data period, with bci as the only predictor. 
### Compute the confusion matrix.
train = (period < 3)
singapore_economy_state_2008_2017 = singapore_economy_state[!train, ]
dim(singapore_economy_state_2008_2017)

glm.fit = glm(crisis_state~bci,data=singapore_economy_state,family = binomial,subset= train)
summary(glm.fit)
glm.probs = predict(glm.fit, singapore_economy_state_2008_2017, type = "response")
glm.probs[1:10]

crisis_state.2008_2017 = crisis_state[!train]

glm.pred = rep("0", length(glm.probs))
glm.pred[glm.probs > 0.5] = "1"

table(glm.pred, crisis_state.2008_2017)
